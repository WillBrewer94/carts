-- Questions --
---------------
1. The motion looks odd since the standard_run starts with the left foot forward,
   and the bogus turn starts with the right foot forward. This could be fixed by
   making sure the two animations start with the same foot forward.
2. You could use Inverse Kinematics on the animation and explicitly place each
   foot on the next stair, ensuring that the animation ends with the player 
   "stepping". This would create a realistic animation where the player actually
   steps on each stair, instead of the ramp approach most games take.
3. At the beginning of the animation when the player falls, perform a 
   Physics.Raycast to find how far the ground is away from the player. This 
   could be used to blend between a falling and landing animation the closer
   the player is to the ground.
   Then, pass the current speed of the object to the animator and use that data to blend  
   between different "falling" animations for the potential speeds. For example, there 
   could be a light falling animation where you only fall a few feet and a high 
   falling animation where you're falling from a great distance. The speed variable
   could be used to blend between these two animations.

-- Requirements --
------------------
All requirements complete. No known bugs.
1. SomeDude_NoRootMotion no longer sends rotation to animator
2. SomeDude_RootMotion running animations added, and blend tree modified
3. SomeDude_RootMotion public scalars added to allow adjustment of animation speed
   and root motion scale.
4. Minion_RootMotion added a "flipping" animation to the minion forward, forward
   turn left, and forward turn right.
5. Minion_RootMotion added minion squeaky sound event to the forward animation
